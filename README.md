<b>*Abstract*</b>

**Background.** The Northern Andean Block (NAB) harbors high biodiversity, being one of the most important areas of the Neotropics, nevertheless, the settlement of several human populations has triggered rapid transformations of the ecosystems, leading to the extinction or endangerment of many species. As phylogenetic diversity indices quantify the distinctness between species, they are an adequate tool to evaluate conservation priority areas. 
**Methods.** We reconstructed 93 phylogenies from 1255 species, and using their occurrence from GBIF, we calculated the Average Taxonomic Distinctness Index for a grid cell of 0.25° in NAB. With the index values of each cell, we classified them into quantiles, selecting those cells with values in the upper quantile (Q5) as the most important cells. We also calculated the contribution of endemic species to NAB’s phylogenetic diversity, and how much Phylogenetic Diversity is preserved within the Protected Areas (PAs).
**Results.** We found that the Andes region has the highest phylogenetic diversity values across the NAB, especially the middle and south regions of Colombia's Cordilleras. We found that endemic species contribute a small percentage of the NAB’s Phylogenetic Diversity (1.2%). The protected areas, although representing a small geographic area, harbor 40% of the total phylogenetic diversity.
**Discussion.** Although the NAB's Andean region has been identified as the most crucial area in terms of Phylogenetic Diversity, there are also regions in the Amazonian Piedemonte and Pacific lowlands that exhibit high levels of Phylogenetic Diversity. Interestingly, some protected areas (PAs) have been found to harbor a higher amount of Phylogenetic Diversity than expected, given their smaller size. While the delimitation of new PAs and species richness has been the primary factor driving the expansion of PAs, it's also essential to consider the evolutionary information of the species if we want to conserve all aspects of biodiversity, or at least cover most of them. Therefore, using Phylogenetic Diversity measures and the results of this study can contribute to expanding the PAs network and improving connectivity between PAs. This will help conserve different aspects of biodiversity and ensure that evolutionary relationships between species are also preserved.
